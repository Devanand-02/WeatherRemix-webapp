The main feature that i wanted to bring to this was the Weather alert sytem and the Weather based on opinions of people currently in the area.So each user can enter their opinions of the weather of the current locality and submit which will be stored in  a databse which will automatically remove itself after 30 min as the weather changes so that info now is not needed so people can get perfect opinions of others on the weather 

why??--> sometimes we dont go to trips because it rains but what if there are some places you can go because there is rain like some forest a rain trecking and all, so using this people of the locality can give opinions of the weather like "There is light rain ,perfect time to come to this place and get wet and enjoy"

Another feature is the alert system where there will be weather alert, the user can set this like i want to take my clothes, since i have hanged for them to get dry so i can set a custom alert saying if it rains within 2 hr notify me 10 min before so i can take necessary precuations 

Why didnt i include them??--> I tried my best but there is some issue with the the google cloud billing and i couldnt use its services like firebase and all, Also the time was a little late when i got this idea
